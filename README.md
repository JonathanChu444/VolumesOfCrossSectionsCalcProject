# VolumesOfCrossSectionsCalcProject
I coded this program to demonstrate volumes using circular and semicicular cross sections to better visualize how they look as I found it tough to understand what their shape was in a 3D space with X, Y, and Z axes because I have never graphed in 3D for math before calculus.
